# Welcome #

Welcome to the Repository for Moneydance Extensions written by Mike Bray.

In this Repository you will find three folders:

1. **downloads** which holds all of the latest .mxt files for my extensions.  These have been built using the latest build of Moneydance.
2. **Images** which holds images for the Wiki (see [Wiki](https://github.com/mrbray99/moneydanceproduction/wiki)).
3. **OldExtensions** which contains build of my extensions compiled against old versions of Moneydance.

Please be careful.  The extensions in **OldExtensions** have not been verified by TIK.  You use at your own risk. I would encourage you to upgrade to a more recent version of Moneydance.
